Discutindo sobre as palavras mais prováveis e quem consegue\r\nmanter mais dias sem perder (ofensiva), me veio a ideia de montar um\r\npequeno app em shiny que aplicasse diferentes filtros em um banco de\r\npalavras (“semelhante” a uma árvore de decisão) conforme o jogo\r\navançasse. Apesar de ser algo com o objetivo lúdico, quando eu paro para\r\nfazer algo que nunca fiz antes, quase sempre acabo aprendendo algo que\r\nutilizo em um outro projeto de trabalho.\r\nMontando o Banco de Palavras\r\nEtapa que me tomou um tempo, primeiramente eu fiz uma raspagem em um\r\ndestes sites de dicionários online com o pacote rSelenium buscando todos\r\nas palavras com 5 letras. A segunda fonte um dicionário em formato epub\r\nque também foi lido e teve as palavras de cinco selecionadas. Dias\r\ndepois que eu já havia montado o banco de palavras inicial eu descobri\r\num banco previamente montado de um dos outros app brasileiros com esse\r\nobjetivo e incorporei ao meu banco que conta agora com 18.540\r\npalavras.\r\nO aplicativo “Busca palavra”\r\nCom o banco de dados montados eu parti para prototipar os filtros,\r\nmontando um esboço de forma linear em R e depois adaptando o script para\r\no app. Dessa maneira o app final ficou da maneira que pode ser vista no\r\nvídeo abaixo.\r\n\r\n\r\nResumindo os elementos aplicativo nós temos:\r\nBotão Tutorial ( “i” verde)\r\n12 Filtros (inputs)\r\nBotão chute para nova sugestão de palavra\r\nVisual (output)\r\n4 cards\r\n1 Tabela com as palavras restantes\r\n1 Gráfico com a Fequência relativa das letras em cada posição\r\n\r\nHospedagem do App\r\nEstava buscando outras maneiras de por o app online não gastando\r\nassim todas as horas do meu shiny.io e acabei me deparando com a\r\nopção do Heroku que eu achei bem interessante. Desta maneira o app pode\r\nser acessado no site https://buscapalavra.herokuapp.com\r\nCertamente daria para\r\nimplementar…\r\nCriar um “segundo chute” com letras que não foram utilizadas antes\r\npara ajudar a eliminar mais palavras. Pode levar a mais trentativas\r\ntodavia ajudar a eliminar mais palavras logo no começo.\r\nTive problemas ao estabelecer uma hierarquia entre os filtros,\r\nconsiderando que são várias rodadas de preenchimento. Dessa Maneira só\r\ntravei o número de letras.\r\nPolir o layout do app e gastar muito tempo.\r\nUm boot para fazer responder o jogo sozinho no Rselenium\r\nperdendo a graça de vez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\nbody {\r\ntext-align: justify}\r\nIntrodução\r\nEsse foi um pipeline que desenvolvi para um artigo utilizando mapas autorganizaveis de kohonen (SOM) para a análise de diversidedade genética de variedades de cana-de-açúcar.\r\nOs dados das siglas das variedades e dos cacteres análisados foram codificados de maneira a manter a originalidade do artigo que esta começando a ser escrito na data de publição deste post.\r\nInformações básicas sobre os dados:\r\n63 variedades (recentes e antigas)\r\n13 Caracteres\r\nDefinição do mapa de kohonen\r\nA definição do número de neurônios (nós da rede) e geralmente feita no chute. Porém existe um método heurístico empregado no metlab (SOM - Supervisionado) que, foi adaptado para o R e eu achei o resultado satisfatório. Desta maneira a grade foi formada por 8 linhas e 5 colunas, totalizando 80 neurônios. Foi utilizada a distancia euclidiana e cinco mil interações para o treinamento da rede. Mais informações abaixo:\r\n\r\n$xdim\r\n[1] 8\r\n\r\n$ydim\r\n[1] 5\r\n\r\n$topo\r\n[1] \"hexagonal\"\r\n\r\n$neighbourhood.fct\r\n[1] gaussian\r\nLevels: bubble gaussian\r\n\r\n$toroidal\r\n[1] FALSE\r\nSOM of size 8x5 with a hexagonal topology and a gaussian neighbourhood function.\r\nThe number of data layers is 1.\r\nDistance measure(s) used: euclidean.\r\nTraining data included: 63 objects.\r\nMean distance to the closest unit in the map: 1.534.\r\n\r\nResultados\r\nA primeira saída é o treinamento da rede. Apesar de não ser um gráfico bonito, o que vale aqui é observar uma “estabilização” conforme o número de interações aumenta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAo menos em alguns artigos de melhoramento que li não vi ninguém mencionando métricas de qualidade de ajustumento do mapa. Todavia, o pacote aweSOM fornece alguns parâmetros:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quality measures:\r\n * Quantization error     :  2.569423 \r\n * (% explained variance) :  79.92 \r\n * Topographic error      :  0 \r\n * Kaski-Lagus error      :  3.263092 \r\n \r\n## Number of obs. per map cell:\r\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 \r\n 4  2  3  1  1  3  2  2  2  0  0  1  1  2  1  2  1  1  4  1  0  2  0 \r\n24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 \r\n 2  3  3  0  0  2  0  0  2  1  2  3  2  2  3  1  1 \r\n\r\nApesar do mapa já nos fornecer um agrupamento, sendo estes os clones inseridos em cada neurônio (tambem chamado de céluas ou subclusters). Estes neurônios (N1 a N40) podem ser agrupados (em superclusters) ,para isso, eu utilizei um metodo hieráraquico (UPGMA) para agrupar e o ponto de corte do dendograma foi o utilizando critério de mojena (k = 1.25). Acredito que esta abordagem é mais palpável que atribuir um ponto de corte aleátório, considerando que neste trabalho não se tem noção de um número ideal de clusters pré definido. Além do dendrogama temos métricas que auxiliam na interpretação da qualidade do dendrograma formado.\r\n\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________ \r\nEstimativa de correlacao cofenetica: \r\n[1] 0.7627311\r\nSignificancia da correlacao cofenetica pelo teste Mantel \r\npvalor: 0.001 \r\nHipotese alternativa: A correlacao e maior que 0 \r\n\r\nPonto de corte pelo metodo Mojena \r\n  k=1.25      k=2 \r\n3.635611 4.404256 \r\n_________________________________________________________________________ \r\n\r\nDe acordo com o ponto de corte estimado acima, cinco grupos são sugeridos e agora eu posso aplicar estes agrupamentos em todas as outras saídas do mapa de kohonen.\r\nComeçando pelo fim aqui eu posso ver (com gráficos interativos) quais e quantos clones foram classificados nos neuronios (pré-clusters) e também os agrupamentos do dendrograma que são representados pelas cores de preenchimento dos hexágonos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{\"x\":{\"plotType\":\"Cloud\",\"sizeInfo\":400,\"gridInfo\":{\"nbLines\":5,\"nbColumns\":8,\"topology\":\"hexagonal\"},\"superclass\":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,4,1,1,1,1,3,3,5],\"superclassColor\":[\"#8DD3C7\",\"#FFFFB3\",\"#BEBADA\",\"#FB8072\",\"#80B1D3\"],\"cellNames\":[\"variedade
